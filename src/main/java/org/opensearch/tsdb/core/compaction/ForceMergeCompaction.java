/**
 * Force merge-based optimization strategy for closed chunk indexes.
 * <p>
 * This optimization strategy calls force merge on individual closed chunk indexes
 * to optimize their segment structure without merging multiple indexes together.
 * Unlike traditional compaction which merges multiple indexes into a new one,
 * this strategy optimizes each index in-place.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is stateless - it always selects the oldest eligible index
 * for force merge. Once an index is force-merged and its segment count drops below
 * the minimum threshold, it naturally becomes ineligible and the next index will
 * be selected on subsequent invocations.
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation enforces that only one index is compacted at a time.
 * The {@link #plan(List)} method returns a single index (or empty list), and
 * {@link #compact(Plan, ClosedChunkIndex)} requires exactly one source index in the plan.

     *   <li>Calculates a safe cutoff considering OOO writes: any block whose max time is within

     * <b>OOO Write Safety:</b> With out-of-order writes enabled, chunks can be written to older blocks if their
     * timestamps fall within the OOO cutoff window relative to Head's maxTime. Since we don't have access to
     * Head's maxTime here, we use a conservative approach: exclude all blocks within (oooCutoffWindow + blockDuration)
     * of the latest block's max time. This ensures we never force merge a block that could still receive writes.
     * <p>
     * This method is stateless - it always returns the first (oldest) eligible index.
     * Once that index is force-merged and its segment count drops below minSegmentCount,
     * it will no longer be eligible and the next index will be selected on the next invocation.
